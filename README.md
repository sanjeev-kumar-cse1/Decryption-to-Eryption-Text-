**Text-Encryption**
• Converts plaintext into ciphertext to protect data from unauthorized access.
• Utilizes encryption algorithms like AES, RSA, or SHA to secure sensitive information.
• Ensures safe transmission by making data readable only to authorized users or systems.
**Tech:** Text Encryption uses AES, RSA, or DES with Python, Java, JavaScript, or OpenSSL for secure data protection.

AES and DES both are in PyCryptodome package, so command is : " **pip install pycryptodome** "

For RSA package install command is : " **pip install rsa** "
